🐍 Python Vault
A collection of my Python practice problems and LeetCode solutions.
This repository is my personal vault where I experiment, learn, and document coding challenges. It includes both algorithmic problems solved on LeetCode and small Python scripts created for practice and fun.

🎯 Purpose
- Strengthen problem-solving skills in Python.
- Build a consistent record of coding practice.
- Showcase efficient and optimized solutions to common algorithmic problems.
- Maintain a vault of reusable scripts and exercises for future reference.

🚀 Features
- LeetCode Solutions: Clean, optimized implementations of popular coding problems.
- Practice Scripts: Small projects and exercises to sharpen Python fundamentals.
- In-Place Solutions: Many problems emphasize modifying data structures directly, following interview-style requirements.
- Learning Journal: Each script reflects my journey of learning, experimenting, and improving.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3
- Platform: LeetCode for algorithmic challenges
- Libraries: Primarily standard Python; occasional use of external libraries for practice

🌟 Future Plans
- Add more categorized LeetCode solutions (Arrays, Strings, DP, Graphs, etc.).
- Expand practice scripts into mini-projects.
- Write detailed explanations and approaches in Markdown alongside code.
